This project is a fork of RoboticsLibrary.

Details: 
http://www.roboticslibrary.org

Build Instructions:
http://www.roboticslibrary.org/tutorials/build-ubuntu

If you want to try the Contact planner:
run build/demos/rlPlanDemo/rlPlanDemo
and open rl-examples-0.6.2/rlplan/box-2d-narrow-region_pcrrt.xml

Hit space to start planning and F12 to reset the planner.


Troubleshooting:
Q: The planner says "start or goal invalid" for the plan file above
A: You need an english number format in your OS. On Ubuntu type "locale" in the shell - there should be something like LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8. If it says something with "DE" you have to change the LC_NUMERIC field in /etc/default/locale 

Q: I cannot build the robotics library under Ubuntu 16.04
A: The launchpad repository is broken for 16.04. Markus Rickert (roboticslibrary developer) told me there will be a new version very soon that works under 16.04. 

However, if you really want to run it with 16.04 you can follow these steps: 
1. use libcoin80-dev and libsolid3-dev as dependencies

2. grep -rl 'dSINGLE' ./ | xargs sed -i 's/dSINGLE/dDOUBLE/g'

execute the following steps in contact-motion-planning:

3. build the CGAL library: (stow is optional but helps uninstalling)
sudo apt-get install stow
wget https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/34512/CGAL-4.5.2.tar.gz
tar -xvzf CGAL-4.5.2.tar.gz
mkdir CGAL-4.5.2-build
cd CGAL-4.5.2-build
CGAL_DISABLE_GMP=1 cmake 
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/stow/cgal-4.5.2 -DWITH_GMP=OFF 
-DWITH_MPFR=OFF -DWITH_CGAL_Core/CMakeLists.txt=OFF 
-DWITH_CGAL_ImageIO/CMakeLists.txt=OFF 
-DWITH_CGAL_Qt3/CMakeLists.txt=OFF -DWITH_CGAL_Qt4/CMakeLists.txt=OFF 
../CGAL-4.5.2
sudo make install
cd /usr/local/stow
stow cgal-4.5.2

then run:

4. cmake -DBULLET_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/include/bullet/ -DSOLID_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsolid3.so ..

5. make (or open in QtCreator)
