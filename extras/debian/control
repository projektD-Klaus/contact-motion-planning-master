Description: Development files for the Robotics Library RL
 This package includes all development files for
 the Robotics Library RL, which is an open source software 
 library for various robotics tasks. 
 It covers mathematics, kinematics, dynamics, hardware abstraction, 
 visualization, collision detection and motion planning. 
 .
 The main author is Markus Rickert at fortiss An-Institut
 Technische Universit채t M체nchen.
 .
 In contrast to other robotics frameworks, it is 
 a self-contained library with a focus on robot motion planning.
